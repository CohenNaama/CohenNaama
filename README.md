#  Naama Cohen – Full-Stack Developer (Backend-Oriented)

Hi there! I'm a full-stack developer with a strong passion for backend technologies — building robust, scalable applications with **Python, Flask, Django, and PostgreSQL**, alongside modern frontend tools like **React, custom Hooks, Redux, and Material-UI**.  
I genuinely enjoy developing data-driven platforms with **real-time features (Socket.IO)**, AI integrations, and clean, maintainable architecture.

##  Featured Projects

### 🔗 [Social App (Bitbucket)](https://bitbucket.org/myfirstflaskapp/)
Advanced fullstack social network built with Flask and React. Supports real-time chat and notifications via Socket.IO, JWT-based auth, Redux state management, and SQL Server integration.

### 🌐 [MetaFetch](https://github.com/CohenNaama/MetaFetch)
A React + Node.js (Express) web app that extracts metadata from user-submitted URLs. Features include a styled multi-input form, Axios API integration, backend validation, and modular Express architecture.

### 🏆 [Trivia VS AI](https://github.com/CohenNaama/TriviaVsAI-Server)
AI-powered trivia game integrating OpenAI, Claude, and Gemini APIs. Generates dynamic, difficulty-adjusted questions in real time with personalized feedback and gamified progression.

### 🔍 [FindMe (Django App – Live Demo)](http://16.171.34.196/)
Lost & found reporting platform built with Django + React. Includes geo-filtered search, real-time user notifications, admin dashboard, and full AWS deployment (EC2, RDS, S3).

*Originally built as my first fullstack app — it laid the groundwork for my backend development journey.* *(Private code repository)*
