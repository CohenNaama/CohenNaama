#  Naama Cohen – Full-Stack Developer (Backend-Oriented)

Hi there! I'm a full-stack developer with a strong passion for backend technologies — building robust, scalable applications with **Python, Flask, Django, and PostgreSQL**, alongside modern frontend tools like **React, custom Hooks, Redux, and Material-UI**.  
I genuinely enjoy developing data-driven platforms with **real-time features (Socket.IO)**, AI integrations, and clean, maintainable architecture.

##  Featured Projects

Distributed microservices platform for intelligent text processing, built with **FastAPI, Kafka, Redis, and PostgreSQL**. Focused on real-world backend architecture with async communication, modular design, and production-ready infrastructure.

- ✅ **Text Receiver** service completed (validation, Kafka, Redis, PostgreSQL)  
- ✅ Docker Compose setup with clean inter-service networking  
- ✅ Pytest-based test suite with custom markers  
- 🚧 **Summarizer** service in development (OpenAI-based)  
- 💡 Designed for scalability, monitoring, and future AI services
