# Naama Cohen - Junior Backend Developer

Welcome to my GitHub 👋 

I'm a junior backend-focused developer, building practical and scalable systems while continuously learning through hands-on experience.  

Since completing a Python Fullstack program, I’ve built 5+ projects (3 deployed to the cloud) using **Python, FastAPI, Flask, PostgreSQL**, often Dockerized and tested with **Pytest**. Some projects integrate AI features (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini), while others explore async services and Kafka pipelines.  

While backend is my main focus and passion, I’ve also built frontends with **React, Redux, and Material-UI** when needed to deliver complete applications.  

🔍 Currently open to junior backend developer opportunities where I can contribute, grow, and collaborate.  
 


##  Featured Projects

Below are some of the hands-on projects I built to sharpen my backend skills and explore real-world architectures:

- ✅ **Text Receiver** service completed (validation, Kafka, Redis, PostgreSQL)  
- ✅ Docker Compose setup with clean inter-service networking  
- ✅ Pytest-based test suite with custom markers  
- ✅ **Summarizer** service in development (OpenAI-based)  
- ✅ Designed for scalability, monitoring, and future AI services
