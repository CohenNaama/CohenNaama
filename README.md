# Naama Cohen - Junior Backend Developer

Welcome to my GitHub 👋 

I'm a junior backend-focused developer, building practical and scalable systems while continuously learning through hands-on experience.  

Since completing a Python Fullstack program, I’ve built 5+ projects (3 deployed to the cloud) using **Python, FastAPI, Flask, PostgreSQL**, often Dockerized and tested with **Pytest**. Some projects integrate AI features (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini), while others explore async services and Kafka pipelines.  

While backend is my main focus and passion, I’ve also built frontends with **React, Redux, and Material-UI** when needed to deliver complete applications.  

🔍 Currently open to junior backend developer opportunities where I can contribute, grow, and collaborate.  
 


##  Featured Projects

Below are some of the hands-on projects I built to sharpen my backend skills and explore real-world architectures:

### ⚙️ [AI-Powered Microservices Platform](https://github.com/CohenNaama/ai-microservices-platform)

- ✅ **Text Receiver** service completed (validation, Kafka, Redis, PostgreSQL)  
- ✅ Docker Compose setup with clean inter-service networking  
- ✅ Pytest-based test suite with custom markers  
- ✅ **Summarizer** service in development (OpenAI-based)  
- ✅ Designed for scalability, monitoring, and future AI services

- ✅ Planned CI/CD pipeline and Docker deployment

### 💬 [AskMe (Flask GPT App)](https://github.com/CohenNaama/AskMe-Server)  
AI-based Q&A platform using Flask + OpenAI API. Dockerized with PostgreSQL, CI/CD setup, and styled with Materialize CSS for clean, responsive design.  
🔗 [Live Demo](https://askmeflaskapp.azurewebsites.net)  
- ✅ Integrated CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions for smooth deployment  
- ✅ Achieved over 90% backend test coverage with Pytest

### 🌐 [MetaFetch](https://github.com/CohenNaama/MetaFetch)  
A fullstack React + Node.js web app that extracts and displays metadata (title, description, image) from submitted URLs in real time.  
🔗 [Live Demo](https://metafetch-zeta.vercel.app)  
- ✅ Implemented async metadata scraping pipeline with fallback logic  
- ✅ Deployed to Vercel with responsive UI and error-handling for invalid URLs


### 🔍 [FindMe (Django App - Live Demo)](http://16.171.34.196/)
Lost & found reporting platform built with Django + React. Includes geo-filtered search, real-time user notifications, admin dashboard, and full AWS deployment (EC2, RDS, S3).

🔗 [Live Demo](http://16.171.34.196)

🌍 Integrated Mapbox for geo-location search (currently disabled to optimize cloud resources).
 
*Originally built as my first fullstack app- it laid the groundwork for my backend development journey.* *(Private code repository)*
