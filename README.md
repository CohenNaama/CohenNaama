# Naama Cohen – Backend Developer

Hi there! I'm an entry-level backend developer, passionate about building scalable systems and learning through hands-on experience.

After completing a comprehensive Python Full Stack Development program, I’ve been actively sharpening my skills through end-to-end projects — building backend systems with **Python, FastAPI, Flask, PostgreSQL**, and adding **React** frontends when needed. My work also includes tools like **Docker, Pytest**, **CI/CD pipelines**, and deployments on **AWS and Azure**. I’ve integrated AI technologies such as **OpenAI, Claude, and Gemini** into production-style applications.

While backend is my main focus, I’m also comfortable working with **Redux, Material-UI**, and other frontend tools to complete the picture.

🚀 I love learning new technologies and continuously aim for clean, maintainable code.  
🔍 I'm open to entry-level backend developer opportunities.
